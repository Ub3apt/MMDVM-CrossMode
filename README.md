This is a new cross-mode conversion program that makes use of the MMDVM-Transcoder to offer previously unavailable cross-mode options. The ultimate aim
is to replace the programs currently available in the MMDVM_CM package in a more integrated manner. It will typically sit between the MMDVM Host and
the appropriate mode gateway, or maybe after a mode gateway and another mode gateway, depending on the configuration.

The final version will transcode between all of the following digital and non-digital voice modes.

- D-Star
- DMR
- System Fusion (DN and VW modes)
